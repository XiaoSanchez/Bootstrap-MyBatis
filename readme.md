# Handwritten-MyBatis

Handwritten MyBatis is a project that aims to provide a deeper understanding of the MyBatis framework by recreating its core functionality from scratch. MyBatis is a popular Java-based persistence framework that simplifies database access and manipulation. By implementing key features of MyBatis, such as session management, statement execution, and result mapping, this project aims to enhance the understanding of how ORM frameworks work under the hood.

## Features

- **Session Management**: Explore the creation and lifecycle of database sessions, including session opening, transaction management, and session closing.
- **Statement Execution**: Dive into the process of preparing and executing SQL statements, managing parameters, and handling result sets.
- **Result Mapping**: Learn about result mapping techniques, including handling various data structures and associating database records with Java objects.
- **Configuration**: Understand how to configure data sources, mappers, and other essential settings for database communication.
- **Error Handling**: Study how to manage exceptions and errors that may occur during database operations.
